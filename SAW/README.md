# AWS libcrypto Verification using SAW
This repository contains specifications and correctness proofs for some cryptographic operations functions in [AWS libcrypto](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lc). All proofs are carried out in [SAW](https://saw.galois.com/) using [Cryptol](https://cryptol.net/) specifications stored in the [Galois Cryptol spec repository](https://github.com/GaloisInc/cryptol-specs).

## Building and Running
The easiest way to build the library and run the proofs is to use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). To check the proofs, execute the following steps in the top-level directory of the repository.

1. Clone the submodules: `git submodule update --init`
2. Build a Docker image: `docker build -t awslc-saw .`
3. Run the proofs inside the Docker container: ``docker run -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` awslc-saw``

Running ``docker run -it -v `pwd`:`pwd` -w `pwd` --entrypoint bash awslc-saw`` will enter an interactive shell within the container, which is often useful for debugging.

The verification ensures that each verified function has the following general properties:
* The function does not write to or read from memory outside of the allocated space pointed to by its parameters. Though an exception to this rule exists in cases where a function frees memory. In these cases, the verification would not fail if the function writes to memory after it is freed.
* The function does not write to memory within the allocated space pointed to by parameters that are intended to be read only.
* The function does not read from memory that has not been initialized with a value.
* If the function is written in C, then it is free from all other undefined behavior.
